# timbre.ws
Online web-based SHARC browser

Created the git repo for this project.  Here's the origins of this code:

1. The principle part of this is the code that was zipped up from the timbre.ws website, which was living on eApps.  
That comprised the dirs browser, includes, share and sharc-angular.  
2. Then I grabbed two projects from /Volumes/LAVALAMP/greg/docs/code, 18thStreetLib and sharcJFreeWeb, and moved 
them into here.  

From all code in this repo, I stripped out all the IDEA files (.idea, *.iml, *.iws, *.ipr), all the target dirs containing compiled java classes.
